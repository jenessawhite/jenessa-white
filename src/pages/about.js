              <p className="font-zilla text-xl">I am a Software Developer based in the Twin Cities (where, yes, it gets cold in the winter, but we have summers y{`'`}all). I enjoy creating simple, beautiful and intuitive websites that solve problems. I've worked at digital agencies & start-ups (both early stage and growth stage).</p>

              <p>Outside of work, but still in the tech world, I enjoy attending conferences and meet-ups. I've had the privilege of being sponsored to go to both JSConf HI & DevOpsDays MSP. I've also been a part of the Minne* unconference <a href="https://minnestar.org/minnebar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MinneBar</a> and presented twice. I think my favorite tech related thing to do though is being on panels. Panels give me a chance to have conversations with others in my field, even if we have different roles, and learn while discussing a number of things.</p>

              <p>I like to live a pretty fulfilling life outside of the tech world too...</p>

              <p>One of my main activities outside of the office is playing Tight End for the <a href="https://mnvixen.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minnesota Vixen</a>! I joined the team in 2018 and have learned so much more about teamwork and myself than I had in a while. Football has taught me some skills that we even can apply to our everyday workflows. Other things I like to do include DIY projects and listening to podcasts. If you ask me about them I could talk to you about them for hours, so proceed with caution. I also love to hang out with friends, watch Netflix, try out new restaurants, attend concerts/sporting events and go on all types of adventures.</p>
